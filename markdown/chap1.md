#   GENERAL GUIDELINES:

-   For each figure, append it with a caption like "Fig 4.1: One-Line Description"
-   Again, include a caption for each table as "Table 1.1: Data of population"
-   Maximize the referencing of each image into the text of the report.
    - However, do this only if it is either necessary, or it enhances the clarity of the text.
