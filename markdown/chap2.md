#   Requirements{#sec:Requirements}

-   List all requirements of the project, like software required/tech stack/
    technology.
-   Also specify the hardware components and tools required.
-   Additional requirements are as per the project.

-   Each requirement category must have a section dedicated to it.

#   Description of the project{#sec:Project}

-   Explain the working of the project.

Below is a State Transition Diagram for a simple traffic light system:

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt, node distance=2.5cm, on grid, auto] -->
<!--     \node[state, initial] (A)   {Red};  -->
<!--     \node[state] (B) [right=of A] {Green};  -->
<!--     \node[state] (C) [below=of B] {Yellow};  -->
<!--      -->
<!--     \path[->]  -->
<!--     (A) edge node {timeout} (B) -->
<!--     (B) edge node {timeout} (C) -->
<!--     (C) edge node {timeout} (A); -->
<!-- \end{tikzpicture} -->
<!-- $$ -->

This diagram shows the state transitions of a traffic light system.

-   As per department/guide concerned, modify this to be several sections/chapters long.

#   Output(OR Outcome) of the project{#sec:Conclusion}
